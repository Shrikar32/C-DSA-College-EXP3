Aim:
To study and implement various operators in C++.

Software Required:
Visual Studio

Theory:
An operator is a symbol that instructs the compiler to carry out specific mathematical, logical, or bit-level operations. C++ is equipped with a wide range of built-in operators, which can be categorized as follows:

Arithmetic Operators

Relational Operators

Logical Operators

Bitwise Operators

Assignment Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators:
These are the fundamental operators used for basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. They are crucial for performing calculations and manipulating numeric data.

2. Relational Operators:
Relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions. The result of a relational operation is a boolean value â€” true if the condition is met, otherwise false. These are essential for decision-making and controlling program flow.

3. Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to perform operations on boolean values. They are particularly useful in complex conditional statements to combine multiple conditions. The three primary logical operators are AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).

4. Bitwise Operators:
These operators work at the bit level and are used mainly in low-level programming, such as hardware interfacing, cryptography, or performance-critical applications. They perform operations like AND, OR, XOR, shift left, and shift right directly on bits.

5. Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign or update values stored in variables. These include the basic assignment operator (=) and compound operators like (+=, -=, *=, /=, etc.).

Implementation:
In this practical, I have demonstrated the usage of different types of operators through the following programs:

Positive or Negative Number Check:
Utilizes relational operators to determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Student Grade Determination:
Applies a combination of relational and logical operators to assign a grade based on the average marks obtained in five subjects.

Quadrant Determination:
Uses relational and logical operators to identify the quadrant of a point based on the x and y coordinates provided by the user.

Conclusion:
Through this practical, I explored various types of operators in C++. I gained hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how these operators function and how they can be used to build logic in programs.
